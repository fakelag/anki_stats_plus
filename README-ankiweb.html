<b>Stats Plus</b> allows you to include the Anki graphs inside of other screens. You can choose the ones you want, and order them as you like!

Configure the graphs under "Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; Stats Plus &gt; Config".
You can add graphs to three different screen: <ul><li><b>Deck Browser</b>: This is the screen that Anki opens with, and where you see your deck hierarchy (screenshot top left)</li><li><b>Deck Overview</b>: When you click on a deck to study it, you first see the Deck Overview. This is where you see the deck description, and have a "Study Now" button (screenshot top right)</li><li><b>Congrats Page</b>: This is the screen, where Anki congratulates you, after you finished all cards in a deck (screenshot bottom right)</li></ul><img src="https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJyb3RhdGUiOjAsInciOjgyMH0%3D/patreon-media/p/post/46354898/d1a80f48a74246e799cb014dcb4d1abf/1.png?token-time=1615827331&token-hash=eZTx8wr5bl-BmD5Ne6LWL30KP7s4t1nSI9Lvb-bdiXU%3D">

If you like my add-ons, you can consider supporting me.
